Hello there

Here you will find instructions and information about phyton file "OOP_5CV"

You can open the phyton file now
In first lines you will find primitive "print" commands

Below you wil find a mathematical game called FizzBuzz
This game works as follows
You and yourfriends are nameing numbers from 1 to "n" ("n" is limitation for the game)
And instead of numbers which are divisible by 3 or 5 you say something else

If number you want to name is divisible by 3, you must say "Fizz" instead
If number is divisible by 5, you say "Buzz"
And if number is divisible by 3 and 5, you say "FizzBuzz"

Game ends when somebody makes mistake or you reach your limitation

Have great fun!
